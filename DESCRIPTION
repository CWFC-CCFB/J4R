Description: Makes it possible to create 'Java' objects and to execute 'Java' methods from the 'R' environment. 
    The 'Java' Virtual Machine is handled by a gateway server. Commands are sent to the server 
    through a socket connection from the 'R' environment. Calls to 'Java' methods allow for 
    vectors so that a particular method is iteratively run on each element of the vector. A 
    score algorithm also makes the calls to 'Java' methods less restrictive. The gateway server
    relies on the runnable 'Java' library 'j4r.jar'. This library is licensed under the LGPL-3. Its
    sources are included in the jar file.
