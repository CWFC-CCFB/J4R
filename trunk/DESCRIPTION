Description: This package makes it possible to create Java objects and to execute methods. 
    The Java environment is handled by a gateway server. Commands are sent to the server 
    from the R environment through a socket connection. In order to compensate for the low  
    performance of socket connections, the package takes into account the concept of vector 
    in the calls to Java methods.
